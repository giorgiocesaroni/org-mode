Visualizer

-----

What types of visualizers should I have?

1. Header (when it's just "*** Something").
This should be white as well?

2. Todo (when it's "*** TODO Something").
Done todo's should be gray.

-----

How should I structure the decision process of these visualizers?

A map between tags and components (visualizers).

-----

What are the common parts between visualizers?

1. A header

2. A scheduling
 
3. A body

4. A footer? (maybe the "add new" button)

Why is this project important

1. It showcases the knowledge of recursive structures.

2. It showcases parsing algorithms.

3. It helps getting closer to Org Mode, which has a steep learning curve.
